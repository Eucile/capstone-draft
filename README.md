### Description

## Name of Project: Blog Engine

### Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal:

A React CRUD app that allows a selection of writers to update and curate community blog posts. May evolve into a musical or creative-leaning forum after MVP is hit but I am focused on making a functioning blog for now that I can specialize down the road. I plan to incorporate both firebase and redux, user authentication, site routing, the ability for users to edit/delete/upload their own posts, and comment on others. My end goal is to open a space that facilitates interaction between like-minded users.   

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Working database and store management with the ability for authorized users to add, edit and delete blog entries.
* Blogs marked and organized by date
* routing throughout, including log in page, blog entry form, about page, home, etc.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React/jsx
* JavaScript
* Redux  
* Firebase

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Admin component with the ability to monitor and edit all community posts
* Search component
* multi-page routing after every 10 posts and better site organization
* Blog calendar and archive component  
* Animations, styles, extra stuff.
* further down the road I would like to teach myself socketing or how to incorporate chat rooms. This project is basically my first step into building a social site.
