### Description

## Name of Project: Blog Engine

### Project’s Purpose or Goal:

A React CRUD app that allows a user(myself) to update and curate personal blog posts. I’d like to continue building off this and make a legitimate blog engine with user authentication and site routing.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* State management with the ability to add, edit and organize blog entries.
* Blogs marked and organized by date
* routing with separate ‘about’ page, etc.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React/jsx
* JavaScript
* Redux  

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Admin route and user authentication (if not MVP)  
* Search component
* multi-page routing after every 10 posts
* Blog calendar and archive component  
* User profiles and ability to leave comments, further interactivity, etc.
